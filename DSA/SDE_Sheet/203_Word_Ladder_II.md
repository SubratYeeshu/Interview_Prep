# Word Ladder II

## Problem statement

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

## Approach 1 : BFS

- Time complexity : O(N^2)  
- Auxiliary space : O(N)
