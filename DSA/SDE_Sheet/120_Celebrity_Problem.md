# The Celebrity Problem

## Problem statement

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not. A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing. 
- Follow Up: Can you optimize it to O(N)

## Approach 1 : 

Time complexity : O(1) 
Space complexity : O(1)

```cpp
