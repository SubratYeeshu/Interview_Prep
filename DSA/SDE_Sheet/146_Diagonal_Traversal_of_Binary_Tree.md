# Diagonal Traversal of Binary Tree

## Problem statement

Given a Binary Tree, print the diagonal traversal of the binary tree.
- Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.
- If the diagonal element are present in two different subtress then left subtree diagonal element should be taken first and then right subtree.
