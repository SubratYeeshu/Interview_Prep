## Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

## Code snippet

```cpp
/*

    -> Disjoint set is used to find whether two elements belong to the same group or not in constant time
    -> Algorithm
        -> We have to maintain two vector rank and parent to store the current rank of a given node 
           and parent of node
        -> For checking if two nodes belong to the same parent their ultimate parent must be same
        -> Union Operation
            -> If the parent comes out to be same then return, that means they belong to same group
            -> Else if the rank of left is greater than right than left becomes the parent of right which 
               ensures no increase in the rank of the former
            -> If the rank is same it does not matter who becomes the parent of whom just increase the rank
               by one and assign the parent
        -> Find operation uses simple recursion to find the parent and also used for path comperession
    -> Used in dynamic changing graphs
    -> Find whether two elements belongs to same parent or not in constant time
