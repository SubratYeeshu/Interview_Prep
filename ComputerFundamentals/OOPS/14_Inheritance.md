# Inheritance

- The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called inheritance.

```cpp
/*
    classA -> baseClass / parentClass / superClass
      |
      V
    classB -> derivedClass / childClass / subClass
*/
```

- Syntax : class childClass:accessSpecifier parentClass

## Mode of inheritance 

- Public Mode : Public inheritance makes public members of the base class public in the derived class, and the protected members of the base class remain protected in the derived class

- Protected Mode : Protected inheritance makes the public and protected members of the base class protected in the derived class.

- Private Mode : Makes the public and protected members of the base class private in the derived class.

## Code Snippet

```cpp
class Base {
  public:
    int x;
  protected:
    int y;
  private:
    int z;
};

class PublicDerived: public Base {
  // x is public
  // y is protected
  // z is not accessible from PublicDerived
};

class ProtectedDerived: protected Base {
  // x is protected
  // y is protected
  // z is not accessible from ProtectedDerived
};

class PrivateDerived: private Base {
  // x is private
  // y is private
  // z is not accessible from PrivateDerived
};
```

## Public mode

```cpp
// C++ program to demonstrate the working of public inheritance

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
  private:
    int pvt = 1;

  protected:
    int prot = 2;

  public:
    int pub = 3;

    // function to access private member
    int getPVT() {
      return pvt;
    }
};

class PublicDerived : public Base {
  public:
    // function to access protected member from Base
    int getProt() {
      return prot;
    }
};

int main() {
  PublicDerived object1;
  cout << "Private = " << object1.getPVT() << endl;
  cout << "Protected = " << object1.getProt() << endl;
  cout << "Public = " << object1.pub << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Protected mode

```cpp
class Base {
  private:
    int pvt = 1;

  protected:
    int prot = 2;

   public:
    int pub = 3;

    // function to access private member
    int getPVT() {
      return pvt;
    }
};

class ProtectedDerived : protected Base {
  public:
    // function to access protected member from Base
    int getProt() {
      return prot;
    }

    // function to access public member from Base
    int getPub() {
      return pub;
    }
};

int main() {
  ProtectedDerived object1;
  cout << "Private cannot be accessed." << endl;  // Because after inherting the getPVT() function it becomes protected which can not be accessed outside 
  cout << "Protected = " << object1.getProt() << endl;  
  cout << "Public = " << object1.getPub() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Private mode

```cpp
// C++ program to demonstrate the working of private inheritance

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
  private:
    int pvt = 1;

  protected:
    int prot = 2;

  public:
    int pub = 3;

    // function to access private member
    int getPVT() {
      return pvt;
    }
};

class PrivateDerived : private Base {
  public:
    // function to access protected member from Base
    int getProt() {
      return prot;
    }

    // function to access private member
    int getPub() {
      return pub;
    }
};

int main() {
  PrivateDerived object1;
  cout << "Private cannot be accessed." << endl;
  cout << "Protected = " << object1.getProt() << endl;
  cout << "Public = " << object1.getPub() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
